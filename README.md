### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Suyash Chavan a second year B.Tech student at Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli. I am a Competitive Programmer and Cyber Security enthusiast(may be more than that). I love to solve CTFs(Not on Machines but related to Cryptography, Web, etc). I also solve CP problems and try to optimise them to their limits.

Talking about development stuff, I generally work on backend in Web Dev projects. I am looking forward for a deployable project that covers multiple domains of Computer Science.
